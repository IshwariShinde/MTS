Software development is indeed one of our core services but deep within we are much more than just a software development company.  </p>
<p>Established in the year 2014 in Pune, Maharashtra, by Mahendra Nikam, Mahendra Technosoft Pvt Ltd. Mahendra Technosoft ventured into software development to fill the vacuum created by expensive software solutions which acted as an obstacle for start-ups, small businesses, solopreneurs and hindered their progress. In order to scale and be competitive, they needed cost-effective and efficient solutions that were at par or even better than the ones available in the international markets.</p>
<p>For that, we created an ecosystem of an unparalleled pool of talent across the country either as freelancers or with us on board. Talent, expertise, and professionalism that we can rely on to help you expand your customer base by providing machine learning, cloud computing, IoT, artificial intelligence, and much more.</p></div></div>
