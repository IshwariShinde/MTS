            <h1>Discovery</h1>
            <p>The first step to develop a piece of software, we need to survey your target customers and understand their needs. In order to do this, weâ€™ll need to carry out in-depth analysis of your target audience. By the end of the discovery phase, we would have a good understanding of what features need to be included in your software. This is where we put our BA and R&D experts to work along with you to do a feasibility study, market research and competitive analysis. Based on which a decision is made to choose the right tech stack that would help us develop a software perfectly in sync with your business strategy and goals.</p>

            <h1>User Journey</h1>
            <p>Developing software can be difficult to do if you don't have a clear plan of what you want your users to experience when using it. That's why we believe that the best way to go about developing software is by first creating a user journey map. This will help show and clarify the steps that users will take when using the software and what tasks they need to complete, as well as any problems they may face along the way. By having this user journey already mapped out, it'll be easier to optimize all the steps in the process so that users can easily accomplish their goal without feeling lost or confused. User journey mapping is an essential tool for any product or website that wants to ensure their users have the best experience possible.</p>
